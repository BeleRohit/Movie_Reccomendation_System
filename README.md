## Section A: Recommendation System using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)

## Section C: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model

This recommendation is however based on Collaborative filtering which uses easily captured user behaviour data. The rating data is represented using a matrix where users are along the rows and products are along the columns.

* Collaborative Filtering
  * Memory based collaborative filtering
    * User-Item Filtering
    * Item-Item Filtering
  * Model based collaborative filtering
    * Single Value Decomposition(SVD)
    * SVD++
