## Section C: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model

The recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering, which relies on user behavior data that can be easily obtained. The rating data is organized in a matrix format where users are represented in the rows and products are in the columns.

* Collaborative Filtering
  * Memory based collaborative filtering
    * User-Item Filtering
    * Item-Item Filtering
  * Model based collaborative filtering
    * Single Value Decomposition(SVD)
    * SVD++
